# Onto business ...

## Objective
Learn about:  

- the different SQL community activities available 
- how they translate into skills you're interested in developing
- who to contact about getting involved

## Attending
- You're doing it right now
- You improve your technical knowledge
- You get to network

Continue as-is

## User group organising
- Either put on events in your local area or assist with the events
- Oxford UG exists, but where are y'all from?
- As a lead organiser, gain lots of organisational skills and improved people skills
- As a team member, gain some organisational skills and improved people skills

- To organise: talk to myself or Craig to help you on the path
- To help Oxford SSUG: talk to Craig or Suzie

## Conference organising
- Either BYOC or help with an existing one
- SQLRelay & SQL Saturdays are prime examples
- As a key organiser, gain lots of management, practical, & people skills
- As a team member, gain lots of practical & people skills

- To be main organiser of brand new conf: just get going
- To be a key organiser of existing conf: email / tweet 
- To be a team member of existing conf: email / tweet (recommended)

## PASS 
- Volunteer portal
- Help at events or get involved with organisation like program selection
- Easier for introverts, gain organisational skills
- Run / assist with a Virtual chapter (see UG slide)

- [PASS website](http://sqlpass.org)

## Helping at events
- On the day helping
- Gain knowledge (room monitoring), people skills

- Keep an eye out for calls for volunteers
- Let organisers know you want to help out
- Offer to help on the day if you notice an extra hand is needed

## Presenting
- From 5 mins to full days
- Excellent way to improve your knowledge, communication and organisation skills

- Talk to your UG leader for a soft start
- Put yourself forward for a lightning talk at events like SQLBits
- Submit sessions when you see a call for speakers

## Blogging
- Disseminate your knowledge to the interwebs
- Great boost to your knowledge, communication and branding skills

- JFDI ... Azure website for free anyone?

## Online helping
- Forums like StackOverflow, and the #sqlhelp tag
- Improve knowledge, research and communication skills

- Again, JFDI

# Skills matrix!

----
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(optiRum)
scores<-fread("SkillMatrix-complete.csv")
ggplot(scores, aes(y=Skill,x=wordwrap(Activity), fill=Level)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high="#90C226") + 
  xlab("") + ylab("")+
  theme_optimum(base_size = 12) + theme(legend.position="none")
  
```

## Conclusion
There's lots of ways you can get involved with the community

I suggest looking at the @SQLRelay account's lists for finding organisers, UGs & conferences to follow  

Now back to the exercise!
